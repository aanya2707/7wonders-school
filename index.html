            <p>This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the world's most iconic 
                monuments and is perhaps the finest example of Mughal architecture. It was built by 
                Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628-58) to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal (“Chosen One of the 
                Palace”), who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. It took about 22 years and 
                20,000 workers to construct the complex, which includes an immense garden with a 
                reflecting pool. The mausoleum is made of white marble that features semiprecious stones 
                in geometric and floral patterns. Its majestic central dome is surrounded by four smaller 
                domes. According to some reports, Shah Jahān wished to have his own mausoleum made out of 
                black marble. However, he was deposed by one of his sons before any work began.</p>

            <p>Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, which flourished in the 
                9th and 10th centuries CE. Under the Mayan tribe Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the 
                Toltecs—a number of important monuments and temples were built. Among the most notable is 
                the stepped pyramid El Castillo (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24 meters) above the
                 Main Plaza. A testament to the Mayans’ astronomical abilities, the structure features a 
                 total of 365 steps, the number of days in the solar year. During the spring and autumnal 
                 equinoxes, the setting sun casts shadows on the pyramid that give the appearance of a 
                 serpent slithering down the north stairway; at the base is a stone snake head. Life 
                 there was not all work and science, however. Chichén Itzá is home to the largest 
                 tlachtli (a type of sporting field) in the Americas. On that field the residents played 
                 a ritual ball game popular throughout pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.</p>

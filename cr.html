            <p>Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount Corcovado in Rio de 
                Janeiro. Its origins date to just after World War I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide 
                of godlessness.” They proposed a statue, which was ultimately designed by Heitor da Silva 
                Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. Construction began in 1926 and was completed 
                five years later. The resulting monument stands 98 feet (30 meters) tall—not including its
                 base, which is about 26 feet (8 meters) high—and its outstretched arms span 92 feet (28 
                 meters). It is the largest Art Deco sculpture in the world. Christ the Redeemer is made 
                 of reinforced concrete and is covered in approximately six million tiles. Somewhat 
                 disconcertingly, the statue has often been struck by lightning, and in 2014 the tip of 
                 Jesus’s right thumb was damaged during a storm.</p>

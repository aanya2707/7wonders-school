            <h2>Machu Picchu</h2>
            <img src="Machu-Picchu.webp">
            <p>This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram Bingham, who believed 
                it was Vilcabamba, a secret Incan stronghold used during the 16th-century rebellion 
                against Spanish rule. Although that claim was later disproved, the purpose of Machu 
                Picchu has confounded scholars. Bingham believed it was home to the “Virgins of the Sun,”
                women who lived in convents under a vow of chastity. Others think that it was likely a 
                pilgrimage site, while some believe it was a royal retreat. (One thing it apparently 
                should not be is the site of a beer commercial. In 2000 a crane being used for such an ad 
                fell and cracked a monument.) What is known is that Machu Picchu is one of the few major 
                pre-Columbian ruins found nearly intact. Despite its relative isolation high in the Andes 
                Mountains, it features agricultural terraces, plazas, residential areas, and temples.</p>
